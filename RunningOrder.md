One of simultaneously the best and worst things about web
development is that things are changing fast.

It didn't always used to be this way.  The JS and web world
stagnated for years, and lots of ugly and unfortunate things
have been simply the only way to do things for a long time.

Now, not only is it changing fast, we're currently getting
lined up for a period of unusually rapid change.

Whether you see this as an asteroid collision causing big 
chunks of current web development practice to go the way
of the dinosaurs and be replaced by a more mammalian way of
doing things, or a Cambrian explosion of new opportunities 
is up to you.

We're going to be looking at some of the biggest changes and
giving you hands on experience of them.  We don't have time to
cover everything in depth, so this will necessarily be a quick
tour.

But in the near future, the changes will be significant. You'll
be coding in a language that looks and feels pretty different
from the Javascript we're used too.  We'll be organising our
code differently, many of the tools and workflows we already
have will die out, and new tools will take their place, and the
platform standards we're building on will have changed
significantly.

There's a quote from William Gibson that's pretty relevant to
a lot of these changes:

"The future is already here â€” it's just not very evenly
distributed."

Because the future is not very evenly distributed, we'll be
occasionally using shims and tools to cover over the holes.
 
As well as giving you a whistle stop tour of the features we
think are most important, we'll also be giving you some hands
on time.
